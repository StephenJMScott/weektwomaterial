1. Read the requirements several times very carefully.
2. Write down what the program should do.
3. Change what you've written into a kind of pseudo-code
4. Change the pseudo-code to actual code

Write a function that writes the multiplication table 
(in one column) of any number passed as parameter.
So, calling multiplication_table(2) will return:
2
4
6
8
10
12
14
16
18
20



Define a function max() that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest 
of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Javascript.
So, calling: max(2,4) will return:
4




Define a function new_max() that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest 
of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Javascript.
So, calling: new_max(10,2,4) will return:
10

Write a function that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and prints a message to say whether
the letter is a vowel or not.
So, calling is_vowel("a") will return:
a is a vowel
Calling is_vowel("s") will return:
s is not a vowel
